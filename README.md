## What is Backtracking Algorithm?
Backtracking is a family of algorithms for solving algorithmic problems, especially constraint satisfaction (optimization or decision). These algorithms allow to systematically test all the potential assignments of the problem. They consist in selecting a variable of the problem, and for each possible assignment of this variable, to test recursively if a valid solution can be built from this partial assignment. If no solution is found, the method gives up and goes back to the assignments that would have been made previously (hence the name of traceback).
